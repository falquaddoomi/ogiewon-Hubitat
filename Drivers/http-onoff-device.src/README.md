# Hubitat HTTP Momentary Switch Driver

This driver implements the "Switch" and "Momentary" capabilities.  It is used to create an HTTP POST, PUT, or GET to a user defined IP Address and Port.  (Note: It can be used to submit an HTTP request to any server, it is not specific to the Harmony Hub in any way.)

The use-case, that this was created for specifically, is to allow Hubitat to issue commands to a Logitech Harmony Hub via the maddox/harmony-api server (see https://github.com/maddox/harmony-api for details.)


Instructions for use

**Create Hubitat Driver**
- Open up the "http-momentary-switch.groovy" driver from this repository (https://github.com/ogiewon/Hubitat/blob/master/Drivers/http-momentary-switch.src/http-momentary-switch.groovy).  Make sure you hit the "RAW" button, then select/highlight all of the source code, and COPY everything (Ctrl-C on Windows, or right click->Copy). 
- In your Hubitat Elevation Hub's web page, select the "Drivers Code" section and then click the "+ New Driver" button in the top right corner.  This will open a editor window for manipulating source code.
- Click in the editor window.  Then PASTE all of the code you copied in the first step.
- Click the SAVE button in the editor window.

**Create Hubitat Device**
- In your Hubitat Elevation Hub's web page, select the "Devices" section, and then click the "+ Add Virtual Device" button in the top right corner.
- In the window that appears, please fill in the "Device Name", "Device Label", and "Device Network Id" fields.  Make sure the Device Network Id field is UNIQUE!  For example:
  - "Device Name" = Harmony Watch Apple TV
  - "Device Label" = Harmony Watch Apple TV
  - "Device Network Id" = HarmonyWatchAppleTV
- In the "Type" field, scroll to the bottom of the list and select "HTTP Momentary Switch"
- Click Save
- In the next window that appears, fill in the "Device IP Address", "Device Port", "URL Path", and "POST, GET, PUT" with values appropriate to your apllication.  For example:
  - "Device IP Address" = 192.168.1.145   (this is the IP Address of my Raspberry Pi running the harmony-api server)
  - "Device Port" = 8282 (this is the PORT number of my Raspberry Pi running the harmony-api server)
  - "URL Path" = /hubs/family-room-harmony-hub/activities/watch-apple-tv  (this is the URL to activate my Harmony Hub's Watch Apple TV Activity)
  - "POST, GET, PUT" = POST  (**NOTE: the harmony-api needs a HTTP POST to turn on a Harmony Activity**) 
- Click Save
- Test your new device by clicking on "On", "Off", or "Push" 
  - **NOTE: ALL OF THESE DO THE EXACT SAME THING!**
  - Since this is really just a Momentary Pushbutton device, all of the commads in it currently execute the exact same code.  They all cause the HTTP request to be sent, as well as creating a "switch on" and "switch off" event.  This allows other Apps to know this device has been activated.  For example, in Rule Machine you could create a Triggered action to dim the lights when the "Watch Apple TV" Activity is activated.  I implemented the "switch" capability to allow these devices to be discovered by the Amazon Alexa integration.  

Here is what your device should look like:

**Tips for using "HTTP Momentary Switch" with the Harmony-API**
- The harmony-api needs to run constantly on another system on your LAN.  I use a Raspberry Pi with a STATIC IP address for this. I did not make any customizations whatsoever to the harmony-api.  It automatically discovers your Harmony Hub(s) and exposes a very helpful website you can use to help create the URLs needed for each of your Harmony Activities.  Simply go to http://192.168.1.145:8282 (substitute your Raspberry Pi's IP address of course) and you will see some very useful information as shown below.

*Turning On a Harmony Activitie*
- In the "Your Hubs" section, you will find the URLs needed to be inserted into your new Hubitat "HTTP Momentary Switch" devices to be able to turn on an Activity.  
- Just strip off the last "/commands" string from any of your Harmony Hub Activities that you'd like to use as a "HTTP Momentary Switch" in Hubitat.  In the image above, you can see an entry for "/hubs/family-room-harmony-hub/activities/watch-apple-tv/commands".  Just drop off the "/commands" and you'll get "/hubs/family-room-harmony-hub/activities/watch-apple-tv" which is exactly the URL needed to be added to your new Hubitat device.
  - "Device IP Address" = **192.168.1.145**            (this is the IP Address of my Raspberry Pi running the harmony-api server)
  - "Device Port" = **8282**                           (this is the PORT number of my Raspberry Pi running the harmony-api server)
  - "URL Path" = **/hubs/family-room-harmony-hub/activities/watch-apple-tv**  (this is the URL to activate my Harmony Hub's Watch Apple TV Activity)
  - "POST, GET, PUT" = **POST**
  - **IMPORTANT - To turn on an Activiy, you must select the "POST" method in your Hubitat "HTTP Momentary Switch" device**

*Turning Off Harmony Hub*
- To shut down your AV system, a special "off" command must be issued to the Harmony Hub.  To do this, simply create one more Hubitat Device using the "HTTP Momentary Switch" driver.  I call mine "Harmony All Off", as it will shut down whatever the current Activity is running. Here are the settings for my system:
  - "Device IP Address" = **192.168.1.145**             (this is the IP Address of my Raspberry Pi running the harmony-api server)
  - "Device Port" = **8282**                            (this is the PORT number of my Raspberry Pi running the harmony-api server)
  - "URL Path" = **/hubs/family-room-harmony-hub/off**  (make sure your put the name of your hub here!)
  - "POST, GET, PUT" = **PUT**
  - **IMPORTANT - To turn off the AV system, you must select the "PUT" method in your Hubitat "HTTP Momentary Switch" device**
  
  
**Random Thought and Future Enhancement Possibilities**

Ideally, Hubitat will provide native Harmony Hub integration in the future.  Until that happens, the above approach seems to work well enough, assuming you don't have an extremely complex Harmony Hub setup.  

A relatively simple future addition would be to create a Service Manager App that could automatically create Child Devices for each Activity and the Harmony Off command.  If anyone wants to take on the challenge, please feel free to do so.  My goal was simply to be able to remove one more dependency on my old SmartThings setup.  This should provide me with enough capability to do that.

The KuKuHarmony integration for SmartThings looks like a nice solution, however the developer has chosen not to implement Harmony Activity control at this time.  He recommends using the SmartThings-to-Logitech integration for Activities.  Thus, I chose to employ the KISS principle and create a very lightweight, albeit somewhat manual, solution.  I rarely add or remove an Activity from my Harmony Hub, so a one-time setup doesn't seem to merit a complicated Service Manager App for now.

**FAQ**
- Why does my Hubitat "HTTP Momentary Switch" Device show "Off" even though that Activity is currently playing on my Harmony Hub?
  - I chose to implement the "HTTP Momentary Switch" device as a true MOMENTARY Switch.  Think of it as a pushbutton that simply starts an activity.  Thus, whenever you call its "push" command, it simply toggles the "switch" attribute to "on" and then immediately to "off".  This allows other Apps and the Amazon Alexa to integrate with it.
  - Since each of your Hubitat "Harmony Activity Devices" are completely standalone, they would have no idea if your turned on a different harmony hub activity.  Thus, keeping their status up to date is a little challenging.  Thus, I chose to keep it simple for now.
  - If anyone wants to improve this behavior, I welcome the support!
